## Introduction

* Ghostbird is a Thunderbird add-on that allows you to edit email text in your favorite text editor using the [GhostText protocol][protocol].
* It works by connecting to a GhostText server (listening on port 4001 by default) via WebSocket and relaying messages between the compose window and the server.
* You can find a sequence diagram in [`doc/design.md`](./doc/design.md#sequence-diagram).

## Tools

Running `yarn` will fetch the rest of the tools, but you need at least the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/) LTS (v22.18.0 as of writing) or a compatible one that can run Yarn
- Your favorite code editor (e.g., [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/))

## Workflow (If you found a typo or just want to add documentation)

* If the edit doesn't touch the code, you can skip the build and test steps below.
* You can just edit the file on the GitHub website and create a PR.

## Workflow (If it involves coding)

* Pick a task from our [project board][proj] or add your own [issue][issue].
  * Pinging maintainers on the issue page or [the discussion page][discussion] is a good practice.
  * Submitting PRs directly to start a discussion is also fine.
* Fork the repo.
* Clone your forked repo and `cd` into it.
* Install Yarn by `corepack install && corepack enable`.
  * See [`.devcontainer/init.sh`](./.devcontainer/init.sh) for example.
  * You might have to prefix the command with `npx corepack` if you're using Node.js v25+.
  * You can continue using `corepack yarn` without installing Yarn globally.
  * See [the note about `corepack` in the Yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/corepack) for details.
* Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
* Run `yarn test` to run tests. If it fails, that's on the maintainers; please open an issue and attach `build/test/result.xml`.
* Run `yarn build` to build the extension.
* Run `yarn start` to launch Thunderbird with the extension loaded temporarily.
* Make your changes.
* Run `yarn test` to run tests.
* Run `yarn check` and `yarn fix` to lint and format.
* Commit and push your changes.
* Create a pull request.
* Install the built add-on and dogfood your changes in Thunderbird in the meantime. (You're using Thunderbird daily, right?)

## Individual tasks

### Build

* Run `yarn build` to build. A zip file will be created in `dist/`.
* Run `yarn watch` to watch for changes and rebuild automatically while editing.

### Read

* See the [Structure section of `design.md`](./doc/design.md#structure) for how the code is organized.
* Run `yarn doc` to generate API documentation.
* Ask on the [issue][issue] or [discussion][discussion] pages if documentation is insufficient to figure out how to implement something.

### Code

* Use your favorite code editor.
* Run `yarn check` to check code style and types.
* Run `yarn fix` to fix issues found with `yarn check`.
* Run `yarn format` to format code.
* Running `yarn sdk $your_editor_name` might make it work more smoothly, e.g., Vim, Emacs, or VSCode. See [Yarn SDK](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks) for details.

### Test

* Run `yarn test`.
* Results are output to `build/test/`.
* See [`doc/testing.md`](./doc/testing.md) for details.
* Not adding test cases is fine, but please describe how to test the changed part manually in the commit message.

### Debug

* It's convenient to use [`yarn exec web-ext run`](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/) to start Thunderbird with Ghostbird loaded temporarily. It's aliased as `yarn start`.
  * However, by default, it starts Firefox, which is not what we want.
  * Copy [`.web-ext-config.example.mjs`](./.web-ext-config.example.mjs) to `.web-ext-config.mjs` and adjust to your environment.
* `web-ext` will start Thunderbird with a blank profile. You may want to use `--keep-profile-changes` to prepare [a testing profile](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/#use-a-custom-profile).
* Also, VSCode can be used as a debugger. See [`.vscode/launch.example.json`](./.vscode/launch.example.json) for an example config. Copy to `.vscode/launch.json` and edit the paths as needed.

### Commit

* Run `yarn fix` to lint and format the code.
* Commit your changes. If you're wondering what to write:

```
${the_folder_name_I_mainly_worked_in}: ${what_I_changed_in_imperative_mood}

${this_change_impacts_users_like_this}
${you_should_merge_my_awesome_commit_heres_why}
```

### Send a pull request

* Push to your forked repo.
* Create a pull request on the GitHub website, or your favorite GitHub client.

## Code style

* We mostly adhere to [biome defaults](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/) for formatting and linting, with some exceptions that reflect my personal preferences.
* You can adjust [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig) and [`biome.json`](./biome.json) to your taste locally, but please make sure to run `yarn fix` with the original config before sending a PR.
* PRs that suggest adjusting these are also welcome, as long as they don't cause a huge rewrite.
